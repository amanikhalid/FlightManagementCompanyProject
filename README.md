# FlightManagementCompanyProject

## Project Progress Summary
I have analyzed the Flight Management Company backend project requirements and clarified the database structure using an Entity Relationship Diagram.

#### 1. Reviewed Project Specification

- Studied all entities, fields, constraints, and relationships as defined in the project brief.

- Understood business rules, required EF Core implementation details, and LINQ-based service methods.

#### 2. Entity Listing with Attributes

- Documented all 11 core entities: Airport, Route, Aircraft, Flight, CrewMember, FlightCrew, Passenger, Booking, Ticket, Baggage, AircraftMaintenance.

- Included primary keys, foreign keys, unique constraints, and important field details for each.

#### 3. Relationships & Cardinalities

- Defined how entities are connected, ensuring referential integrity.

- Mapped every connection between entities based on the business model.

#### 4. Relationship Verbs (Business Meaning)

- Added clear verbs to describe the relationships.

- This helps bridge the gap between technical schema and business understanding.

#### 5. ERD Drafting

- Created an initial ERD diagram mapping entities and relationships.

- Planned improvements to enhance clarity with relationship verbs on connectors.
